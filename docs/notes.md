# Workspace Setup
We will create a workspace using nrwl.io Nx extensions.

```
create-nx-workspace <YOUR-WORKSPACE-NAME> --npm-scope=<YOUR-SCOPE-NAME>
create-nx-workspace angularlicious-workspace --npm-scope=angularlicious
```

Create some libs for the workspace.

```
ng generate lib <library name here>
```
